# Identicon

This project is a plain elixir test developed to build an Identicon image.

An identicon image is like the default avatar image on github. It's a 250x250 image that is mirrored.

# How to test it:
Run: `iex -S mix`
And then call: `Identicon.main("test")`

The image is saved on identicons folder.
